### Software Engineering
- diagram the logic of your application before any coding
- parallel code/diagram - code while diagramming your work so you dont have to look back at your diagram and try to implement all of your blue print
### Workflow management
- reduce the amount of redundant tasks done by setting up your workspace early on

# After finishing adv java assignment 1, what did i learn?
- ## Building Software design habits
	- think about relationships between classes like a "pipelined" workflow
		- i.e 
			- #### Adv. Java Assignment 1
				- Automotive DEPENDS on Option Set
				- OptionSet DEPENDS on Option
				- Utility package class FileIO ASSOCIATES with Automotive.
					- FileIO associating with Automotive also creates associations with classes Automotive depends on.
		- ## Thinking Atomically
			- polymorphism
				- find common behaviors between classes to provide 
					- also gives reason to use an interface or abstract class
				- i.e in video games
					- enemy is a game entity
					- player is a game entity
					- they both can attack but they attack differently.
					- they move differently.
	- ## Use Class Diagrams to help ideate or flesh out system design logic
