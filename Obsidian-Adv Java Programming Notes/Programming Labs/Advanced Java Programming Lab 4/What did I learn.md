# Quick Notes
- multi-threading
- test application using interfaces instead of class instances
	- interfaces also act as extended data types
- need to think deeper about what and how APIs are used
- make abstract class instances static to update the instances
- Unsynchronized Thread Testing:
	- two threads trying to modify an object simultaneously
	- leads to corruption of data
- Sychronized Thread Testing:
	- more taxing on performance
	- different threads can access an object's data and modify it without problems

- ## Multi-threading
	- **processes** - a task
	- **multi-tasking** - executing multiple tasks at a time
	- **multi-threading** - 
		- divding tasks between a thread
		- thread based multi-tasking
	- **multi-processing**: switching from one process to another, and allocating procesing time while switching.
	- ### Thread LifeCycle
		- New: thread is created
		- Runnable: when start() method called over thread processed by the thread scheduler
			- 1) thread A: can be running
			- 2) thread B: can not be running
		- Running: when it hits case 1, scheduler has selected the thread to transition from runnable state -> run state
		- Blocked: when it hits case 2, scheduler has selected the thread to not be allowed to change state from runnable to run
		- Terminated: when run method exits or stop()
- ## Using Synchronized Functions
	- synchronized
		- multiple threads working on single object with object locking
			- must be properly used or risk performance issues
			- dont have to worry about nested functions
			- currently called synchronized function locks down accessing object
		- ## Steps
			- 1. create a class with modificble attribute, instantiate class object
			- 2. either implement runnable or extend Thread
			- 3. create threads
			- 4. pass object being modified into threads
			- 5. perform thread access and modification

	- unsynchronized
		- multiple threads working on single object with object locking
			- faster than synchronized but can lead to data corruption or concurrency exception
