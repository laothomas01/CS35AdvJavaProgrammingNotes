## Summary
- custom exception handler
- learn about how and why use interfaces
- learn about how and why use abstract classes
- what is difference between abstract classes and interfaces
- what is the "self healing software" feature we created?

# Lab Part 1
- ## using abstract class, interfaces
	- use abstract class to encapsulated instances of our automobile class
	- let's create a class that extends the abstract class called BuildAuto so it can instantiate those encapsulated instances
	- let's create interfaces: why?
		- interfaces are a way for developers to determine which class methods from the backend should be public
		- we make a 'create auto interface', a 'fix auto interface' and an 'update auto interface'
		- create auto - contains a build auto function used to instantiate the automobiel class and a print auto to find an automobile and print its values
		- fix auto - for handling software exceptions
		- update auto - update the values of the automobile such as name and price
	- the abstract methods within these interfaces are implemented into the build auto class
		- we define the function of those abstract methods based on the methods we defined within classes such as automobile, and fileio.
- the overall picture to paint here:
	- in lab 1 we created a backend with FileIO to load data, and base model reference to perform CRUD operations. 
		- we also made the option and option set class protected and had to re-define the functionalities of those class' functions inside the automobile class therefore creating a high level of abstraction: we know there is some functionality happening in the back end by looking at the automobile class but we dont really know what is behind the scenes.
	- in lab 2 we are building an API(application programming interface)
		- in our interfaces, we specify the methods from public classes we want users to use while hiding away knowledge about our backend
		- our build auto class is contracted by the interfaces it implements to find uses for their abstract methods
	- we divide functionaltiy between interface and abstract class:
		- the interface is for making methods we want public
		- abstract class is for acting as an encapsulator for instances of classes related or associated to the automobile class

- ## Part 1
	- ### Abstract Method
		- method that has no body
		- sub-class must implement the method
		- always public
	- ### Abstract Classes
		- what functions do you want sub classes to expose?
		- class can only extend 1 abstract class
		- if many closely related entities have common functionalities, use an abstract class
			- i.e Enemy and Player extend abstract class Entity.
			- Entity contains common functions such as attack, heal, defend.
			- both Enemy and Player can defend, attack and heal
		- can define abstract methods
			- contractually has to be implemented 
		- can be used to encapsulate instances of closely related classes
			- i.e abstract classes
	- ### Interfaces
		- used to expose methods from sub classes
			- these become APIs
		- classes can implment multiple interfaces
		- contains methods you decide are to be public
		- variables are final type
		- adds functionality to unrelated classes
			- i.e Player can swim so it implements swimmable interface
		- doesnt have to define abstract methods
			- can be used as just a type extension
		- can define abstract methods
		- can be used to define classes are specific types of entities
			- Player is SWIMMABLE but Enemy is not
	
	- ### Abstract Classes vs Interfaces
		- both can define abstract methods
		- abstract classes allow for creation of regular methods and variables alongside abstract methods
		- abstract classes can keep adding non-abstract methods without forcing a contract by sub-class to implement it
		- interfaces force a contract by sub-class to implement its methods
- ## Part 2
	- ### Custom-Exception Handling
	- 
	- ### "Self-Healing Software"
	- its an algorithm that search for the potential solution based however you write your solution
	- there should be a limit to how long you must attempt to find your solution and break if there is no solution
	- algorithm points out where the solution is at what location
